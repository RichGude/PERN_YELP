A list of all of the commands to be utilized in the PostGres SQL Shell:
for help:		\?
list databases:		\l
list tables:		\d
list table schema:	\d [table_name]

create database:	CREATE DATABASE [db_name];
connect to database:	\c [db_name]

create table:		CREATE TABLE restaurants (
				id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
				name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
				location VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
				price_range INT NOT NULL CHECK (price_range >= 1 AND price_range <= 5));
delete table:		DROP TABLE products;

add column:		ALTER TABLE [table_name] ADD COLUMN [col_name] [col_type];
delete column:		ALTER TABLE [table_name] DROP COLUMN [col_name];

add document:		INSERT INTO restaurants (id, name, location, price_range)
				VALUES (123, 'Taco Bell', 'New York', 1);
			*NOTE: single quotes is necessary for strings

aggregate functions:	SELECT COUNT(*) FROM restaurants;
			SELECT TRUNC(AVG(rating), 2) AS average_review FROM reviews;
			SELECT AVG(rating) FROM reviews WHERE restaurant_id = 2;
			SELECT location, COUNT(location) from restaurants GROUP BY location;
			SELECT * FROM restaurants INNER JOIN reviews ON restaurants.id = reviews.restaurant_id;

CREATE TABLE reviews  (
	id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
	restaurant_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES restaurants(id),
	name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	review TEXT NOT NULL,
	rating INT NOT NULL check(rating >= 1 and rating <=5)
);

create a join table:	SELECT * FROM restaurants LEFT JOIN (SELECT restaurant_id, COUNT(*), TRUNC(AVG(rating), 1) AS average_rating FROM reviews GROUP BY restaurant_id) reviews ON restaurants.id = reviews.restaurant_id;
